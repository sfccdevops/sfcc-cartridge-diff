Examples
---

#### Comparing Client Cartridge to All Cartridges:

> This is the Default Behavior and will compare the provided cartridge to ALL cartridges in the current directory ( event nested ones ).

```bash
sfcc-diff --cartridge app_client_name
sfcc-diff -c app_client_name
```

#### Comparing Client Cartridge to Specific Cartridges:

> If you only care about a couple of cartridges, you can speed things up by specifying which ones to compare against.

```bash
sfcc-diff --cartridge app_client_name --include storefront-reference-architecture,third_party_core
sfcc-diff -c app_client_name -i storefront-reference-architecture,third_party_core
```

#### Comparing Client Cartridge to All Cartridges Except Specific Ones:

> For when you want to compare your client cartridge to ALL cartridges, but want to leave a couple out.

```bash
sfcc-diff --cartridge app_client_name --exclude link_paypal,int_payeezy
sfcc-diff -c app_client_name -e link_paypal,int_payeezy
```

#### Comparing Client Cartridge to All Cartridges using Only Modified Files:

> Limit compare to just the modified files from your client `--cartridge` in your current git commit.

```bash
sfcc-diff --cartridge app_client_name --modified-only
sfcc-diff -c app_client_name -m
```

#### Comparing Client Cartridge to All Cartridges and just show Junk Files:

> Sometimes a file gets copied over to override another cartridge, but ends up not being modified.  These junk files are normally hard to catch via `git` since the file is technically new.

```bash
sfcc-diff --cartridge app_client_name --junk-only
sfcc-diff -c app_client_name -j
```

#### Comparing Client Cartridge to All Cartridges and Filtering for ISML Files:

> If you want to limit the results to just what matches a filter, you can use the `--filter` flag.  This will match on the entire relative URL, not just the file name.

```bash
sfcc-diff --cartridge app_client_name --filter .isml
sfcc-diff -c app_client_name -f .isml
```

#### Comparing Client Cartridge to Specific Cartridge and Generate Diff:

> Want to actually see the changes between cartridge files? Just pass in a the Diff option and it will render it in your terminal window.

```bash
sfcc-diff --cartridge app_client_name --include storefront-reference-architecture --diff
sfcc-diff -c app_client_name -i storefront-reference-architecture -d
```

#### Comparing Client Cartridge to Specific Cartridge and Generate Diff in External App:

> Want to use an existing Diff Tool to generate the diff instead of displaying it in your terminal window? Just pass in the name of a tool you already have configured with git.

```bash
sfcc-diff --cartridge app_client_name --include storefront-reference-architecture --diff=ksdiff
sfcc-diff -c app_client_name -i storefront-reference-architecture -d ksdiff
```

**NOTE:** In order to use an external app, you will need to have one configured in your `~/.gitconfig` file.

Here are a couple of apps you can use for external diffs, and how to configure them.
